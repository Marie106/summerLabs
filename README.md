Section 1
JavaScript Total Recall




Setup
For this walkthrough, create a HTML, CSS & JSREPLfrom repl.it -- you can name it "JavaScript Review Lab".



I. Variables & Datatypes
To answer these questions, you can add them in a multiline comment section inside of script.js
like this:
/*
1. How do we assign a value to a variable? A. With the assignment operator
2. How do we change the value of a...
...
*/



A. Q + A
How do we assign a value to a variable?
How do we change the value of a variable?
How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?



B. Strings
For all other questions that involve writing code, you can solve them via the following instructions.
Create a variable called firstVariable
Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
Change the value of this variable to some number
Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called secondVariable
Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
What is the value of firstVariable?
Create a variable called yourNameand set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourNameso that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean



C. Booleans
Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks so that all log statements print true in the console. Answers should be all be valid JS syntax and not weird things that don't make sense but happen to print true to the console
  const a = 4;
  const b = 53;
  const c = 57;
  const d = 16;
  const e = 'Kevin';

  console.log(a __ b);
  console.log(c __ d);
  console.log('Name' __ 'Name');
  // FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||
  console.log(true __ false);
  console.log(false __ false __ false __ false __ false __ true);
  console.log(false __ false)
  console.log(e ___ 'Kevin');
  console.log(a __ b ___ c); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)
  console.log(a __ a ___ d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"
  console.log(48 __ '48');



D. The farm
Declare a variable animal. Set it to be either "cow" or something else
Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the it is equal to cow
Change your code so that if the variable animalis anything other than a cow, it will print "Hey! You're not a cow."
Commit



E. Driver's Ed
Make a variable that holds a person's age; be semantic
Write code that will print out "Here are the keys!", if the age is 16 years or older, or, if the age is younger than 16, a message should print "Sorry, you're too young."
